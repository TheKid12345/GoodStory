There was a boy named matt who was walking through the jungle. He saw a tiger. He got scared and ran the other way. While running matt tripped on a tree brand and fell. Matt twisted his ankle. Then got caught by the tiger, the tiger ate himThe tiger wasn't full after eating the boy, so he went to look for more food. He saw a river along the way and drank some water.
The story ends here, it was a tale of much dispair and the boy ended up dead. Very sad stuff. THE END.
